**Round Spot** simplifies the UI accessibility and behaviour analysis for Flutter applications by handling the data gathering and processing. It produces beautiful heat map visualizations that aim to make the UI improvement and troubleshooting easy and intuitive.

## üöß State üöß
This tool is still in active development - the core functionality is mostly working but many important features are still missing.

## Usage
> **‚ö†Ô∏è Note:** This package is not yet published to `pub.dev`

To start using **Round Spot** within your app, import it in your main file:
```dart
import 'package:round_spot/round_spot.dart' as round_spot;
```
> **‚ö†Ô∏è Note:** Using a `round_spot` prefix is highly recommended due to potential name collisions and better readability

### Setup
Wrap your `MaterialApp` widget to initialize the library:
```dart
void main() {
  runApp(round_spot.initialize(
    child: Application()
  ));
}
```
Add an observer for monitoring the navigator:
```dart
MaterialApp(
  navigatorObservers: [ round_spot.Observer() ]
)
```

### Configuration
Provide the callbacks for saving the processed output:
```dart
round_spot.initialize(
  heatMapCallback: (data) => sendHeatMapImage(data)
)
```
Configure the tool to fit your needs:
```dart
round_spot.initialize(
  config: round_spot.Config(
    minSessionEventCount: 30,
    outputTypes: { round_spot.OutputType.graphicalRender },
    heatMapStyle: round_spot.HeatMapStyle.smooth
  )
)
```
### UI Instrumentation

#### Route naming
This library uses route names to differentiate between pages.
Make sure you are either:
- Using [named routes](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook/navigation/named-routes) or
- Specifying `name` in [RouteSetting](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/RouteSettings-class.html) when pushing a [PageRoute](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/PageRoute-class.html)

#### Scrollable widgets
To correctly monitor interactions with any scrollable space a `Detector` has to be placed between the scrollable widget and the widgets being scrolled:
```dart
SingleChildScrollView(
  child: round_spot.Detector(
    child: /* child */,
    areaID: id
  )
)
```
